# कागद 
### [kaa-_gad_] | _noun_
> #### meaning: paper _(orig. Konkani)_

Lightweight textarea for note-takers that love less and seek more.

Inspired by [Typehere.app](https://typehere.app).

Built using [React](https://react.dev) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Note: Yes, I know it is entirely possible (and easier) to develop this project using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. But I had to practice my React skills and it is just easier to implement some of the additional functionality using React. For anyone wondering how to develop this  _vanilla_ mode, here you go: [कागद Codepen](https://codepen.io/probablyliquid/pen/QWRXPdg).
